Use the code from the last few exercises to randomly color 5 squares in the grid.
Run your code a few different times and check out the results.
Hint: You'll need to call setColor inside randomColorGrid!

/* Exercise
[Note: students might not know loops yet]
Use loops to randomly color every square in the grid
