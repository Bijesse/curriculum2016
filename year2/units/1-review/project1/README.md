#Unit Review: Project 1 || Scavenger Hunt


##Scope
In this session students will first go through a round of ice-breaker activities. They will then pair up to complete a [series of challenges](clues.md) that will test their skills on topics covered in ScriptEd year 1. 


##Estimated Completion Time
No more than 120 minutes should be allocated to this project. 

##Teacher Notes & Pro Tips
* Require students to pair up with someone who is not in their school. Create a community within the class!
* Print copies of the [clues worksheet](clues.md) before class.
* Decide how you are going to keep score. Most teams use a whiteboard.
* Have prizes ready. Candy is a fan-favorite.
