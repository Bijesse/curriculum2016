##Estimated Completion Time
This unit should take 2 sessions to complete. Project may take less or more time depending on students' needs but should not exceed 3 sessions.  

##Teacher Notes & Pro Tips
* The HTTP request found [here](https://developer.foursquare.com/start/search) has spaces in it. Students often get tripped up by this.
