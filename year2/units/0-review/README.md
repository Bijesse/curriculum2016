#Unit: Foundations Course Review 


##Scope
This unit will begin with some ice-breaking activities. It will then ask the students to compete in an activity that will test their knowledge of concepts taught in the first year of ScriptEd. After which, teachers will spend some time covering some foundational skills. The teachers may choose which skills need to be revisited.

| Session | Description |
|-------|-------|
|[Scavenger Hunt](project1) | In this session students will first go through a round of ice-breaker activities. They will then pair up to complete a [series of challenges](project1/clues.MD) that will test their skills on topics covered in ScriptEd year 1. | 
|[Review](project2)| In this session volunteers may choose to revisit certain skills from the first year curriculum if they feel the class needs the refresher. Volunteers may choose which units (if any) need revisiting. **This project may be skipped if the volunteer team feels a refresher is not necessary for the class as a whole.**|
