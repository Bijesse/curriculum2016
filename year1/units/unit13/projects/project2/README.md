* A step may take less or more than one class. Be prepared to work through this at your class's necessary pace.
* Teacher may choose to have students work alone or in pairs.
* Solutions from the last step are given to students the following day. This is to avoid having students fall more than 1 day behind. 
* This project is HARD! Remind the students of this frequently.
* Have a pizza party when this project is over....They, and you, deserve it
