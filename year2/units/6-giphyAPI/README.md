#Unit: Giphy API


##Scope
In this session, students will create a webapp using the Giphy API. The webapp will consist of an input field and button that will be used to display gifs based on user input.

##Estimated Completion Time
This unit should take 2 sessions to complete. Project may take less or more time depending on students' needs but should not exceed 3 sessions.  

##Teacher Notes & Pro Tips
* Students will be introduced to JSON in this project. For now, it is best to compare an API call to just being a large object.
