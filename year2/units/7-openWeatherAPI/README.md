#Unit: Open Weather API


##Scope
In this session, students will create a webapp using the Open Weather API. The webapp will consist of an input field and a button that will be used to display weather dependant on the area the user queries. 

##Estimated Completion Time
This unit should take 2 sessions to complete. Project may take less or more time depending on students' needs but should not exceed 3 sessions.  

##Teacher Notes & Pro Tips
* The protocol might need to change on the API endpoint depending on the network you are on. HTTPS seems to be buggy with Open Weather.
