#Unit 14: Capstone Project


##Scope
Students will be compiling all their knowledge from the year in a final project which resembles a "space invaders" style game. Students will be broken up into groups of 2-3

##Estimated Completion Time
This project should should take 6 lessons (270 min) to complete. Project may take more or less time depending on students' needs

##Teacher Notes & Pro Tips
* This project will span several classes. It is important to start off each day with a do now and end each day with a scrum. This keeps everyone focused.
* Students often set unrealistic daily goals. Encourage them to break up goals in to very small, attainable tasks.
* To save time, Scrums can be completed in small groups with one volunteer assigned to each scrum.
